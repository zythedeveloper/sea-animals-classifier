# Sea Animals Classifier

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing a machine learning model to classify sea animals based on given data. The project explores different machine learning techniques and evaluates their performance.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Model training and evaluation
- Use of popular ML libraries such as TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, and Pandas
- Performance metrics and visualization

## Technology & Techniques

- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries Used:** TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning Techniques:**
  - Supervised learning approach with deep learning models
  - CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) for image classification
  - Data augmentation for better generalization
  - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
  - Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
  - Transfer learning with pre-trained models such as ResNet and VGG16

## Development Pipeline

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing:**

   - Gather image datasets of sea animals
   - Perform data cleaning and augmentation
   - Split dataset into training, validation, and test sets

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

   - Visualize class distribution
   - Identify potential data imbalances and take corrective measures

3. **Model Selection & Training:**

   - Implement baseline models for performance comparison
   - Train CNN-based deep learning models
   - Apply transfer learning with pre-trained architectures
   - Optimize hyperparameters for best performance

4. **Evaluation & Validation:**

   - Use multiple metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) for performance assessment
   - Conduct cross-validation to ensure robustness

5. **Model Deployment:**

   - Export the trained model
   - Integrate with an API or application for real-world use
   - Deploy on cloud platforms if required
