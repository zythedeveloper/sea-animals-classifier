                This project endeavors to develop a sophisticated deep learning and convolutional neural network (CNN) system designed specifically for the precise and efficient classification of marine animals. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, the project seeks to address the inherent challenges associated with manual identification and traditional methods prevalent in the field. A key aspect of the project involves meticulously defining an optimal CNN architecture tailored to the complex task of classifying marine species accurately. Additionally, efforts will be directed towards enhancing and preprocessing existing datasets containing marine animal data to ensure the robustness and reliability of the classification system. Furthermore, the project meticulously evaluates the performance of each system through systematic comparison with existing methodologies, aiming to highlight the superiority and efficacy of the proposed approach. Ultimately, the overarching goal of the project is to demonstrate the considerable potential of such a system in effectively managing marine ecosystems and supporting critical conservation initiatives aimed at preserving biodiversity and safeguarding the marine environment.
